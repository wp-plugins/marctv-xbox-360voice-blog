Displays the latest entries of your 360 voice gamerdna blog either as a widget for your sidebar or as a customizable function.

== Description ==

Displays the latest entries of your 360 voice gamerdna blog either as a widget for your sidebar or as a customizable function. The xml data from 360voice is being pulled twice daily with wp_cron.

== Installation ==

= Server Requirements =

This script requires at least PHP 5.0 and support for 'simplexml_load_file'. In the case that this won't work for the majority of people out there I will rewrite the script to support cURL.

= Basic =

* Register a 360Voice Blog for your XBOX Live Gamertag: http://www.360voice.com/forum/register-full.asp
* Upload the "MarcTV XBOX 360Voice Blog" plugin to your plugin folder or install from within wordpress
* Activate it.
* Enter your XBOX Live Gamertag in the "XBOX 360 Voice Blog" option page under settings.
* Customize the settings according to your needs
* Save your settings
* Go to "Appearance" -> "Widgets"
* Drag the "XBOX360Voice"- Widget into your sidebar

Note: If you don't have a theme with sidebar support skip to the "Advanced" tutorial below.

= Advanced =

If you are a little bit more experienced and want to customize the output just use the template function of this plugin:

'$xbox360voice_plugin->get_xbox360voice_blog($username = "", $rl_name = "", $class_title = "", $class_list = "", $class_desc = "", $class_item = "",$class_clist = "",$class_citem = "")'

You can use it in your template like this:

`<?php $xbox360voice_plugin->get_xbox360voice_blog('MarcTV', 'Marc', 'title', 'clr container_12', '', 'grid_4', 'clr container_12', 'grid_8'); ?>

The first two parameters are the XBOX Live Username and your reallife name. The others are the various css classes you can define.

Have fun!
